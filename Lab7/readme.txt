Given the data I collected, I have information on the attack, defense and archetype of a specific creature from pokemon, yu-gi-og, hearthstone and magic the gathering. For on e of my visualizations, I decided to display the strength of all of the yu-gi-oh synchro monsters in my database with a bar chart. With this visualization you can see which of the monsters are the strongest, weakest, and in between. For my second visualization, I wanted to focus on the 151 pokemon in my database. I already used the attack key-values for yu-gi-og so I wanted to be something different which required me to add a new key-value pair to all the documents in the database. I added a new key called "type" to the database so I can gather the distribution of the different types of pokemon among the 151 in the first generation. I used a pie chart to display these frequencies. I had to issues that I was not able to resolve. Once the node server is up and running, the first time I view the page on the browser, I am able to see both of the visualizations. But whenever I try to refresh the page, the yu-gi-og bar chart does not appear because the query to mongogb fails - even though it works the first time. If i restart the server, the query works fine and as intended, but does not work when refreshing the page or trying to query another time. The other issue I could not figure out is how to get a specific pie segment to be a color I wanted it to be. I played around with the domain and ranges of the color scale property but the colors appear to be assigned based on ascending order of the values.
